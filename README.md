# Alexa-Youtube-Streamer
A program that streams Youtube videos, controlled by Amazon Alexa.

Currently requires a bluetooth speaker to be connected to the device running the script.
Hopefully this will be fixed in the future to use Amazon Alexa's speaker.
Other planned improvements include:
- Providing a list of search results to choose from, rather than using the first result
- Using AWS instead of a local script to avoid using ngrok and allow anyone to use this Alexa skill.
